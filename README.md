my introduction to programming was Khan Academy's JavaScript course. i started it purely because my older brother was doing it and i wanted more than anything to be just like him.

the first actual things i created in JavaScript were discord bots and NodeJS web APIs.

after that I got into a load of web development. mostly React, but a bit of Vue and Svelte as well.

i tried to create mobile apps in React Native, but decided i only liked React for the web. so i learnt Dart and started creating apps using Flutter.

recently i've been learning Ruby and Rust. the projects I'm creating to learn Rust: <a href="https://github.com/matievisthekat/chum" target="_blank">Chum, a simpler alternative to Git</a>, and Ruby: the API for <a href="https://github.com/TrailBuddies" target="_blank">Trail Buddies, a mobile app to find new friends to hike with</a>

i have also been honing my Next.js skills by creating a <a href="https://github.com/matievisthekat/spotify-playlist-generator" target="_blank">Spotify Playlist Generator, create playlists based on audio features (dancability, valence, tempo, etc..)</a>
