<h4 id="timeline">Timeline</h4>
My introduction to programming was Khan Academy's JavaScript course. I started it purely because my older brother was doing it and I wanted more than anything to be just like him.

The first actual things I created in JavaScript were Discord bots and NodeJS web APIs.

After that I got into a load of web development. Mostly React, but a bit of Vue and Svelte as well.

I tried to create mobile apps in React Native, but decided I only liked React for the web. So I learnt Dart and started creating apps using Flutter.

Recently I've been learning Ruby and Rust. The projects I'm creating to learn Rust: <a href="https://github.com/matievisthekat/chum" target="_blank">Chum, a simpler alternative to Git</a>, and Ruby: the API for <a href="https://github.com/TrailBuddies" target="_blank">Trail Buddies, a mobile app to find new friends to hike with</a>

I have also been honing my Next.js skills by creating <a href="https://github.com/matievisthekat/spotify-playlist-generator" target="_blank">a Spotify Playlist Generator, create playlists based on audio features (dancability, valence, temp, etc..)</a>
